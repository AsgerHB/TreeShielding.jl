# TreeShielding

[![Build Status](https://github.com/AsgerHB/TreeShielding.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/AsgerHB/TreeShielding.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)


Synthesis of safe strategies using binary trees as the data structure. 

Synthesis is done using a Grow/Update/Trim loop. Check out the [Pluto Notebooks](./notebooks) in that order, to gain an understanding of the details. They are quite well doccummented if I do say so myself. Too well docummented for a prototype almost.
